      "“Arriba de Monte Teide” is inspired by my trip to Madrid, Spain and the Canary Islands where I was engulfed in historic and mountainous landscapes. The collection's title, “Above Mount Teide,” relates to a mountain on Tenerife Island whose peak reaches above the clouds. Through my designs, I wanted to express the dreamlike and weightlessness of the vibrant terrain that lives in my memory. I pulled inspiration from historical Spanish garments, matador costumes, and climates of different regions to form the silhouettes of the collection that collaborate with a rich color palette. Overall, this collection works to embody the romanticism of walking through the fantastical travels of the past, and how we can begin to lose ourselves when living in this daydream haze.",

      'Defined as the process of wasting away, of degeneration, and of becoming vestigial, atrophy describes the fleeting sensation that our line puts to a halt. Paused in time, our designs capture the degeneration of cells through bodies and motion. The continuous process of cellular movement captures a part of the action in a stop-motion frame that is then revitalized as it is worn and adapted to the action of a live body. Only when the piece is in motion is it put back into play and the fluid passage of gradual decay continues. The development of this cycle is displayed as our line progresses from the first piece to the last, with each design beginning to lose its rigidity and shape, parallel to cellular contraction in its advancement towards a terminal in a loss of composition. Through a seamless transition of these frozen pieces of time, this line showcases the continuation of the organic cycle of regeneration, contraction and digression through biomimetic influences.',

And an attachment to cohesion and perfection refuses to accept the nature of our lives and our world in favor of the plastic, the artificial. The practice and labor of self-subsistence and self-production promote conscientiousness and connect us to our delicacy as an alternative to emotionally and physically disconnected production and outsourced labor markets. delicacy is a five-piece line inspired by subsistence labor using deadstock and reused materials.',

It's a name given to me by my mom, who has given me numerous gifts throughout the years: sewing lessons, appreciation for art, and encouragement to let my creativity flourish. I've thought a lot about the various fleeting moments I've tried to capture, and the act of doodling is present in many of them. As a child, I doodled on my mom's freshly-painted walls. I doodled in the margins of my science notes in seventh grade, on the white paper table covers at casual restaurants, and on a chalkboard in a classroom during my final semester of college. Throughout these fleeting moments, I've let my creativity flourish, and this line is another product of that practice.",

It follows the opposing desires of the immigrant experience – one to preserve the self and another to assimilate in an unforgiving environment, ultimately capturing the fleeting nature of one's cultural identity. Each look draws upon motifs reinforced throughout our childhoods, often as an act by elders to preserve traditional cultural mindsets. Narratives are told through the lens of Chinese mythology, the eight virtues, and satirical takes on western media influence; all ways in which language forms and shapes outward perceptions of culture. As the collection evolves, innocence and nostalgia eventually unravel into a caricature of what is left of one's authentic self, taking tangible experiences to construct a subversive patchwork between the traditional and the contemporary.",
